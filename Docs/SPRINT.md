# SPRINT.md — Backend Integration Plan for WRECTIFAI

**Created**: 2026-07-03
**Goal**: Replace all hardcoded frontend data with live API calls, building out the backend to match `DATA_API.md` and `001_initial_schema.sql`.

---

## Current State Assessment

### What Exists
| Layer | Status |
|-------|--------|
| PostgreSQL Schema | 20 tables migrated (`db/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql`) |
| API (Express) | Skeleton only — health check + stub auth route |
| Web (Next.js) | 15+ pages built, **all data hardcoded** in components |
| Mobile (Expo/RN) | Minimal — home screen + navigation shell |
| Docker Compose | PostgreSQL configured with auto-migration |

### What's Hardcoded (Frontend)
| Page | File | Hardcoded Data |
|------|------|----------------|
| Home Dashboard | `data.tsx` | navItems, categoryItems, maintenanceItems, garages[], seasonalDeals[], careTips[], overviewItems[], emergencyItems[], promoItems[] |
| Garage Listing | `garages-page.tsx` | 12 garage objects with ratings, distances, chips |
| Quotes | `quotes-page.tsx` | quotesList[], aiEstimatedQuoteRange, quoteContextDefaultIssueIds (imported from `quotes-shared.ts`) |
| Deals & Offers | `deals-page.tsx` | 18 deal items duplicated x3 for pagination |
| AI Diagnosis | `ai-diagnose-page.tsx` | legacyResultIssues[], legacyResultSummaryItems[], resultNextSteps[], analyzing steps |
| Diagnosis Config | `issue-intake-config.ts` | 6 issue categories, 24 questions, 18 possible issue results — all static |
| Diagnosis Flow | `diagnose-flow-shared.tsx` | resultIssues[] shared across pages |

## Sprint Plan

### Sprint 0 — Foundation (API skeleton + DB connection)
**Duration**: 2-3 days

- [ ] Set up PostgreSQL connection pool (Drizzle ORM or raw pg)
- [ ] Create `src/config/database.ts` with connection string from env
- [ ] Create `src/modules/` folder structure per domain (auth, vehicles, diagnosis, garages, quotes, bookings, marketplace, payments, reviews, admin)
- [ ] Set up middleware stack: CORS, body-parser, error-handler, request-logger
- [ ] Set up JWT infrastructure: token generation, verification, refresh tokens
- [ ] Create shared response helpers (`success()`, `error()` envelope per DATA_API.md)
- [ ] Verify `docker-compose.yml` runs PostgreSQL + migrations successfully

**Deliverable**: API boots, connects to DB, returns `{ data }` envelope.

---

### Sprint 1 — Auth + RBAC (Google OAuth Only)
**Duration**: 3-4 days
**API Endpoints**: §1 of DATA_API.md

- [ ] `POST /auth/google` — verify Google ID token → login/register, issue JWT access + refresh tokens
- [ ] `POST /auth/refresh` — rotate access token
- [ ] `POST /auth/logout` — invalidate refresh token
- [ ] Auth middleware: extract user + roles from JWT, attach to `req.user`
- [ ] Role-check middleware: verify `user_roles` mapping (not profile inference)
- [ ] Seed default roles on first run (already in migration)

**Frontend Changes**:
- [ ] Create `src/lib/api-client.ts` (fetch wrapper with auth headers, base URL)
- [ ] Integrate Google Login button & token exchange flow on web
- [ ] Store tokens in httpOnly cookies or secure localStorage
- [ ] Wire TopNavbar user state to `/auth/status` or JWT payload

**Deliverable**: Users can register, login, and hit protected routes.

---

## Architecture Decisions

### Tech Stack (API)
- **Runtime**: Node.js + Express (already in place)
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM (lightweight, type-safe, good PostGIS support)
- **Auth**: Google OAuth (via `google-auth-library`), JWT (access + refresh tokens)
- **Storage**: S3-compatible (AWS S3 or MinIO) for media uploads
- **Payments**: Stripe (per PRD: "US-supported like Stripe")
- **Validation**: Zod schemas shared between API and frontend

### API Conventions (from DATA_API.md)
- Base path: `/api/v1`
- Auth: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
- Success: `{ data, meta? }`
- Error: `{ error: { code, message, details? } }`

### Frontend API Client
- Create `src/lib/api-client.ts` with:
  - Base URL from env (`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`)
  - Automatic auth header injection
  - Token refresh on 401
  - Response envelope unwrapping
  - Error normalization
